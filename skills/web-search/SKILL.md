# Web Search Skill

When the user asks you to search the web, find information online, or look up current events, use the `browser` tool to:

1. Navigate to a search engine (e.g., `https://www.bing.com/search?q=<query>` or `https://duckduckgo.com/?q=<query>`)
2. Extract the search results using the `extract` action
3. If needed, navigate to specific result URLs for more detail
4. Summarize the relevant information clearly

## Example usage

User: "What is the latest news about AI?"
→ Use browser to navigate to a search, extract results, and summarize.

## Guidelines
- Always cite the source URL when providing information from the web
- Be concise — summarize rather than dump raw content
- If the browser is not available, say so clearly
