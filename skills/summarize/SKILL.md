# Summarize Skill

When the user asks you to summarize a URL or document:

1. If a URL is provided, use the `browser` tool to navigate to it
2. Extract the main content with the `extract` action
3. Provide a clear, structured summary including:
   - **Key points** (3-5 bullet points)
   - **Main conclusion** (1-2 sentences)
   - **Source** (the URL)

## Guidelines
- Keep summaries concise (under 300 words unless asked for more)
- Use bullet points for readability
- Preserve important numbers, dates, and names
